### You woke up
### However this time you woke up in your work place remembering everything, and realising it's a beautiful dream before you have to face the reality again
### that day you exit the school and realised how boring school is and you can just do this and escape school
### teacher call home and your parent try to stop you and get you back to school, but you refused and continual doing whatever you want
### the day go on like this day by day, you fall school and wasn't able to graduate highschool
### you saw the disappointment in your family's face, and hear your friends laughter
### now you are in your 20 when everyone you know are in collage or getting a good job, you look like a 40 year old man working in a harsh job where you get paid low
### you cried, regret but there's nothing you can do now.
## True Ending (good)
